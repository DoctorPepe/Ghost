# Ghost (On Hold)

Ghost is a prototype packet radio protocol utilizing FM radio packet on the amateur radio bands. The name "Ghost" represents the utilization of end-to-end encryption and subaudible tones, similar to CTCSS tones. The purpose of the encryption is not to obscure the message, but to prevent tampering and ensure the authenticity of the packets themselves as they travel across the bands.
