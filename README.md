# Ghost (On Hold)

Ghost is a simple, esoteric language designed to be as minimalistic as possible while maintaining a level of useability (that is for an esoteric language).

In ghost, the user creates specters (this spelling is intentional), which are segments of boilerplate code which are saved within the languages files. Reguardless of class or even instance, specters can be called in any program or segment of code. This makes redundent or repetative code easy to read and write.
